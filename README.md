Antithesis client

The Antithesis client is a browser-based tool for making annotations on
Antithesis pages. Itâ€™s a client for the [Antithesis server][service], where it
is intended to be directly embedded. It's a fork of the
[Hypothesis client][upstream]. Aside from the goal of integrating with the
Antithesis server, it's also intended to be more privacy-conscious, by removing
all third-party requests and unneeded tracking, so that the only data leaving
the browser is what is needed to use the service.

Development
-----------

To build the client, you need to have `make`, [Node.js][node] v6.3+, and
[Yarn][yarn] installed. If you're using Debian/Ubuntu/etc., note that while it's
likely possible to get Node.js and Yarn from the default apt repos, it's
generally not recommended, since they don't get frequent updates, and there's a
good chance you won't be able to build. Follow the instructions on the
respective sites to install them instead (using their respective apt repos is
recommended).

Once you have those set up, building consists of running `make app` in the top
level source directory, with the `API_URL` environment variable exported with
the URL of the API root (including the leading `https://`/`http://` and trailing
`/`). For development builds, keep in mind that this URL should be the full URL
from the perspective of the browser, not the host, so use forwarded ports as
needed. If this is intended to be a production build, then you should also
`export NODE_ENV=production`. If you're using oauth for some reason (Antithesis
doesn't support it, but h does), then you'll also need to export the
`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. 

To install on the Antithesis server, copy the `build/` directory as Antithesis's
`root/client/` directory. If it hasn't been set up already, you'll
also need to add the following line to the "HTML code to append to each regular
page" setting of the full Antithesis site config (it's under "Layout" on that
page):

`<script src="http://[antithesis-url]/client/boot.js"></script>`

where `[antithesis-url]` is the location you're running the Antithesis server.
